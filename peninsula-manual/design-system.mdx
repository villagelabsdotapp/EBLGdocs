## Why a Docs Lego Kit Exists

A strong documentation system should scale without becoming generic noise. For Peninsula, that means we reuse structural units while customizing policy and workflow content by client.

Reusable units create three advantages:

- Faster page authoring with consistent quality.
- Easier governance review because structure is predictable.
- Better cross-client portability with less rewrite effort.

## Core Lego Units

<div className="vl-grid">
  <LegoBlock title="Context Card" body="Defines the decision or workflow context in plain language before technical detail." />
  <LegoBlock title="Boundary Block" body="States what is in-scope, out-of-scope, and hold-zone for policy and data controls." />
  <LegoBlock title="Decision Block" body="Captures options, recommendation, rationale, and owner for clear accountability." />
  <LegoBlock title="Mechanics Block" body="Explains process steps and why each step exists in operational terms." />
  <LegoBlock title="Risk Block" body="Lists failure modes, signals, and mitigation plan for resilient deployment." />
  <LegoBlock title="Evidence Block" body="Links claims to citations, logs, exports, and measurable acceptance checks." />
</div>

## Recommended Page Composition

1. Open with intent and audience.
2. Define scope boundaries and assumptions.
3. Explain mechanics with a visual map.
4. Add controls, risks, and decision checkpoints.
5. End with operator actions and ownership.

## Reusable Card Pattern

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What" icon="circle-info">
    One concise paragraph defining what this page or section solves.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Why" icon="lightbulb">
    The reason this matters to quality, governance, delivery speed, or risk reduction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="How" icon="gear">
    Process mechanics with numbered steps and practical thresholds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Evidence" icon="shield-check">
    Data points, metrics, and checkpoints used to validate correctness.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Reusable Explainer Pattern

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Explain in one sentence">
    Start with a plain-language summary before introducing architecture terms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Explain from first principles">
    Describe inputs, transformations, outputs, and constraints.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Explain operationally">
    Show where this appears in daily workflow and who is responsible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Explain governance impact">
    Clarify the audit and risk implications of getting this wrong.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reusable Diagram Template

    C --> D["Selective Processing"]
    D --> E["Index + Retrieval"]

    F --> G["Human Review Gate"]
    G --> H["Approved Output"]
    G --> I["Feedback + Re-index"]

## Authoring Rules for Generalization

- Keep reusable wording in standard pages and snippets.
- Put client specifics in overlay pages only.
- Keep decision thresholds explicit and editable.
- Separate product truth from implementation assumptions.
- Treat diagrams as control maps, not decoration.
