  <p className="vl-subtitle">Manual Overview</p>
  <h2>Reusable Core + Client Overlay</h2>
  <p>
    This manual is intentionally split into a stable Peninsula operating core and an EBLG-specific overlay. It is authored as an architecture, policy, and inspection manual rather than a click-by-click product walkthrough.
  </p>
</div>

<ManualPrinciples />

## Purpose

This documentation package is structured in two layers:

1. A reusable Peninsula operating manual for any client implementation.
2. An EBLG-specific profile that captures scope, controls, and decisions.

It reflects key board-level concerns raised by Kevin Long and Erica: openness, exportability, integration readiness, privacy boundaries, and phased rollout discipline.

## Peninsula At A Glance

Peninsula is a governed intelligence layer over firm knowledge systems:

- It ingests and structures firm data into a knowledge graph.
- It activates Kelso to produce source-grounded work product.
- It preserves partner reasoning patterns as long-term institutional assets.
- It remains configurable so EBLG can phase capabilities responsibly.

## What This Manual Is and Is Not

- It is a system definition for leadership, IT, and implementation teams.
- It is an inspection and audit reference for defensibility.
- It is not a feature-tour or button tutorial.
- It is not a substitute for client governance ownership.

## Operating Cadence

- Weekly: issue triage, query miss review, and retrieval quality check.
- Monthly: policy deltas, workflow adoption review, and backlog reprioritization.
- Quarterly: portability drill, export validation, and control effectiveness review.
