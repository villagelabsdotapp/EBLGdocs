  <p className="vl-subtitle">Manual Overview</p>
  <h2>Reusable Core + Client Overlay</h2>
  <p>
    The manual is intentionally split into a stable Peninsula operating core and an EBLG-specific overlay. This preserves consistency across clients while allowing each implementation to define scope, controls, and workflow specifics with precision.
  </p>
</div>

<ManualPrinciples />

## Purpose

This documentation package is structured in two layers:

1. A reusable Peninsula operating manual for any client implementation.
2. An EBLG-specific profile that captures scope, controls, and decisions.

It reflects key board-level concerns raised by Kevin Long and Erica: openness, exportability, integration readiness, privacy boundaries, and phased rollout discipline.

## Audience Paths

<div className="vl-grid">
  <div className="vl-chip">
    <h4>Board & Leadership</h4>
    <p>Start with Kevin requirements and EBLG profile to evaluate governance posture and decision coverage.</p>

  <div className="vl-chip">
    <h4>Implementation Team</h4>
    <p>Start with the indexing primer and standard manual to configure data pipelines and retrieval quality.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="vl-chip">
    <h4>Operations Team</h4>
    <p>Use deployment and handoff docs to manage publishing, audits, and platform continuity.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="vl-chip">
    <h4>Future Client Teams</h4>
    <p>Apply the generalization framework to build new overlays without rewriting the core manual.</p>

## Operating Cadence

- Weekly: issue triage, query miss review, and retrieval quality check.
- Monthly: policy deltas, workflow adoption review, and backlog reprioritization.
- Quarterly: portability drill, export validation, and control effectiveness review.
