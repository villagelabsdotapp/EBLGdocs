title: "EBLG Implementation Model"
description: "How Peninsula is implemented at EBLG with low-lift collaboration, phased delivery, and measurable outcomes."

## Implementation Philosophy

The implementation model is low-lift for EBLG:

- Village Labs performs most technical setup and integration work.
- EBLG provides data access, preferences, and iterative feedback.
- Weekly working sessions drive configuration and refinement.

This is a collaboration model, not a heavy internal project burden.

## Input Required from EBLG

| Input type | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Data access to approved systems | enables ingestion and indexing |
| Template and style preferences | aligns outputs to firm standards |
| Policy decisions (scope, confidentiality) | governs safe usage boundaries |
| Feedback on outputs and workflows | improves quality over time |

## 12-Week Delivery Rhythm (Reference)

| Phase window | Primary outcomes |
| --- | --- |
| Weeks 1-2 | discovery, data mapping, taxonomy and security planning |
| Weeks 3-4 | infrastructure deployment and connector setup |
| Weeks 5-8 | data ingestion, graph construction, module development |
| Weeks 9-10 | Kelso calibration and quality benchmarking |
| Weeks 11-12 | pilot rollout, training, acceptance, launch readiness |

## Success Metrics

Recommended v1 targets:

- Retrieval accuracy benchmark at or above 95% on test set.
- All licensed users active within 30 days after pilot launch.
- Measurable reduction in drafting and research cycle time.
- Critical partner knowledge capture complete before transition milestones.

## Core Implementation Tradeoff

EBLG can start with base platform capabilities and add deeper custom modules over time, or accelerate full intelligence depth early by implementing modules in parallel.

Recommended for EBLG:

1. Preserve module phasing discipline.
2. Prioritize outdated advice detection and style enforcement early.
3. Keep governance and audit controls as hard gates before expansion.

## Board-Ready Summary

This implementation is designed to:

- preserve institutional expertise,
- improve work-product throughput,
- reduce quality and stale-advice risk,
- maintain inspectability and portability from day one.
