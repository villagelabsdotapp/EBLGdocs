## What Generalize Well Means

For Peninsula documentation, generalization means:

- The same core operating model can be reused across clients.
- Client-specific policy and workflow differences are isolated in overlays.
- Teams can onboard quickly without re-litigating architecture basics.
- Governance artifacts remain auditable and comparable across implementations.

## Adaptation Workflow for New Clients

1. Copy the latest approved core standard.
2. Create a new client overlay page set.
3. Define policy boundaries and data source permissions.
4. Set indexing/OCR thresholds and retrieval acceptance criteria.
5. Build requirement traceability from stakeholder asks to controls.
6. Publish with deployment runbook and ownership matrix.

## Minimum Client Overlay Checklist

- Goals and constraints
- In-scope/out-of-scope/hold-zone policy
- Knowledge taxonomy starter
- Indexing and OCR profile
- Workflow pack (phase 1 and phase 2)
- Requirement traceability matrix
- Open decisions register
- Board/operator FAQ

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Over-customizing core pages for one client.
- Hiding policy decisions in informal notes.
- Treating indexing as all-or-nothing.
- Shipping workflows without explicit human review gates.
- Skipping export and portability validation.

## Canonical Artifact Set

- `standard-manual` as the baseline source of truth.
- `client-overlay` pages for each implementation.
- `requirements-traceability` page for stakeholder confidence.
- `deployment-and-ops` page for publishing continuity.

This structure gives Village Labs a repeatable documentation operating system, not a one-off client deliverable.
