## Quick Definition

Kelso is Peninsula's execution agent layer. It is designed to perform work, not just answer one-off questions.

## Prompt vs. Agent

| Concept | Meaning | Operational consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt | instruction for how to respond in a given moment | useful for ad hoc tasks, ephemeral behavior |
| Agent | persistent worker with tools, memory, and task execution logic | supports repeatable workflows and higher consistency |

## What Kelso Can Do (Base)

- Query EBLG knowledge corpus in natural language.
- Return source-grounded outputs with citations.
- Draft documents and structured analysis artifacts.
- Propose follow-up actions and request clarification when confidence is low.

## What Kelso Can Do (With Workflow Programming)

- Execute multi-step workflows across systems.
- Trigger specialized sub-agents for parallel task execution.
- Apply firm templates and style rules to output.
- Maintain standardized process quality across teams.

## Multi-Model Strategy

Peninsula supports multiple leading model providers. Model choice can be:

- user-selected for a task,
- system-routed based on workload type,
- constrained by client policy and confidentiality requirements.

Policy principle: model routing can vary, but retrieval evidence and governance controls remain consistent.

## Cross-Platform Execution Pattern

Kelso can read from connected systems by default. Write-back behavior depends on destination system APIs and approved permissions.

| Operation type | Expected capability |
| --- | --- |
| Read from source systems | standard |
| Analyze and synthesize | standard |
| Create deliverables | standard |
| Update external system records | conditional on API and policy |

## Suggested Default Behavior Pack

For EBLG v1:

1. Always provide citations for substantive legal outputs.
2. Provide confidence markers and request clarifications on ambiguous facts.
3. Offer suggested next steps after each major output.
4. Route low-confidence or novel-issue outputs to senior review.

## Why This Matters

Kelso should be treated as a programmable digital workforce:

- broad capability for ad hoc tasks,
- deep reliability for high-frequency workflows once configured,
- continuous improvement through structured feedback and policy updates.
